Download and have a look at the "CloneDetectiveProject 2014-01-25 0 Unit Testing POC.rar". It is in Drop Box.

unpack above *.rar file in ..xampp\htdocs

Open Browser and navigate to following page (this URL may need some attention regarding domain name and port etc)
http://localhost:1234/CloneDetectiveProject/index.php/test/toast_all

On the resulting page search for "test_some_action"
Note there is no : "test_some_action2" (with the 2 at the end)

open file
..CloneDetectiveProject\application\controllers\test\My_test_class.php

Duplicate the following function:

	function test_some_action()
	{
		// Test code goes here
		$my_var = 2 + 2;
		$this->_assert_equals($my_var, 4);
	}

Rename the newly pasted funtion
	function test_some_action2()
	
In Browser and navigate to following page
http://localhost:1234/CloneDetectiveProject/index.php/test/toast_all

in browser search for "test_some_action2"
Notice that now "test_some_action2" is present


Question (Jan 26, 2014): Will there be any change required to test any other modile ?
